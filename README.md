# MPTCP-Quality-of-Experience-Measurement
Quality of Experience Measurements of Multipath TCP Applications on iOS Mobile Devices


This dataset is related to the publication “Quality of Experience Measurements of Multipath TCPApplications on iOS Mobile Devices”  (Katharina Keller, Patrick Felka, Jan Fornoff, Oliver Hinz, Amr Rizk) MMSYS 2020.

# Description 
The dataset can be used to investigate correlations of the network measured metrics with the QoE results from the user study, e.g. (i) for the streaming case objective QoE metrics combining average bitrate and bitrate jitter or (ii) for the interactive mobile game the response time of different requests. Finally, other aspects of the user study offer the possibility to investigate the QoE obtained by MPTCP in relation to willingness to sacrifice mobile data volume.

It contains a readme file with a detailed overview on the data structures and explanations of the network data and survey components.
